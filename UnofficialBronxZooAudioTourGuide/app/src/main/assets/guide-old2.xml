                    <paragraph>Southern Pudu are the smallest
                        deer on earth, measuring from 0.6 to 0.825
                        meters long. They're found in nature in
                        the temperate zone of Southern Chile
                        and in Argentina in the adjacent region. Their
                        native climate is on average warmer and wetter
                        than New York, but is still considered
                        temporate rather than tropical. Their maximum lifespan in
                        captivity is thought to be about 18, and in nature about
                        10 years. They eat
                        fallen fruit, ferns, vines and small
                        tree foliage. These animals get most of liquid from their
                        food, and are
                        only occasionally seen drinking water.

                    <paragraph>Baby Chilean Pudu have white spots on their coat.
                        Males have short (less than 10 cm) spike antlers. Pudu
                        mate in the fall
                        and give birth in the spring (bare in
                        mind in Chile the seasons are
                        opposite). Usually only one fawn
                        is born per year. It takes three
                        months for a fawn to
                        become full sized, six months for a female to
                        reach
                        sexual maturity and eighteen months for males.
                    </paragraph>
                    <paragraph>Chilean Pudu, being super cute, have been captured
                        in the wild for use as
                        pets, contributing to their
                        declining population. It's speculated that the reason
                        they have evolved to be
                        so small is to be able to
                        more easily slip though the dense
                        undergrowth and
                        bamboo thinkets in their native environment.

                    <paragraph>This is a giraffe, the tallest living terrestrial animal
                        which has facinated humanity for millenia. 2016 estimates
                        indicate that there are around 100 thousand of
                        these animals in the wild, with more than 1500 in zoos.
                        Although giraffe are traditionally considered one
                        species, research in mitochondrial and nuclear DNA
                        reveals that there are actually eight species. Giraffe
                        are members of of the Giraffidae family, along with their
                        closest living relative, the endangered okapi (which you
                        can also find not far from here). Giraffe are found
                        in the wild in various pockets, mostly in southern half of
                        Africa.
                    </paragraph>
                    <paragraph>Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands.
                        Their food source is leaves, fruits and flowers of
                        woody plants, which they can get to easier than any
                        of the competition thanks to their long necks. They
                        are preyed upon lions, leopards, spotted hyenas and
                        African wild dogs (all of which you can see here
                        nearby except for African leopards).
                    </paragraph>
                    <paragraph>Giraffes live in herds of related females and
                        their offspring, or in bachelor herds of unrelated
                        males. Giraffes are very social and sometimes
                        these herds hang out together. Males establish
                        social hierarchies through "necking", where they
                        combat using their necks as weapons. Dominant
                        males gain access to females, who do all the
                        child rearing.

                        or 200 to 300 pounds, or as much as two adult humans.

                    <paragraph>Ostriches were almost wiped out in the 18th
                        century due to hunting for feathers. By the middle of the
                        19th century, the practice of farming ostriches began to spread.
                        This enabled ostriches to be domesticated and plucked, instead
                        of being hunted and killed. Currently, the demand for ostrich
                        feathers has lessened greatly, and ostriches seem to have a
                        secure population.

                    <paragraph>Legend has it that in Pompeii, a city in
                        ancient Rome preserved by a vulcanic eruption, there was a
                        fountain, fed by the waters of Mount Vesuvius. All those
                        who drank from it would be gifted with superhuman
                        health, wealth and looks. The fountain went dry
                        after Mount Vesuvius erupted and the citizens of Pompeii
                        lost their superhuman blessings.
                    </paragraph>
                    <paragraph>In 1943, Hyman Gould visited and brought a 12 inch lead
                        pipe which proportedly once carried the waters of Mount
                        Vesuvius, back home to the Bronx as a souvineer. He reached
                        out to the Bronx Chamber of Commerce who came up with an
                        idea: They were going to build a drinking fountain on
                        Fordham road for the citizens of New York with water
                        flowing through the same pipe, probably to get people
                        to visit the Bronx.
                    </paragraph>
                    <paragraph>This is what remains of that idea and the pipe that runs
                        through the fountain. You can't drink from it today, but
                        that's okay since drinking water from old lead pipes is
                        generally frowned upon by modern health experts.

                    <paragraph>Dippin' Dots is an ice cream snack invented by Curt
                        Jones in 1988, created by flash freezing ice cream mix
                        in liquid nitrogen. Dippin' Dots is based in Paducah,
                        Kentucky and is sold in 14 different countries. You can't
                        buy Dippin Dots in most grocery stories because it
                        requires temperature below -40 degrees Fahrenheit, -40
                        degrees celsius, to store. Although they're not cheap,
                        if you've never had Dippin' Dots before you'll really
                        only find them in places like this (theme parks, zoos,
                        and aquariums) and they filed for Chapter 11 backruptsy
                        protection in 2011, so it's hard to say if they'll be
                        around forever.
                    </paragraph>
                    <paragraph>Dippin Dot's was invented in Illinois, when Curt
                        Jones, who specialized in cryogenics, was trying to
                        create more efficient fodder for farm animals in his
                        parents garage. Because of the ultra cold freezers
                        the company uses for the product, sparked interest when
                        vaccines were developed for COVID-19 that required
                        storage at -94Â° F (-70Â° C). Pharmacists and distributors
                        of those vaccines reached out for those freezers.
